### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- I'm currently working as an Engineering Managaer at Shuttl. I deal with new problems everyday - be it technical, people or project.
I have primarily worked in Python and Java (but yes, lanaguage doesnt define you ðŸ˜„).

- I'm currently learning Neural Networks. 

- I'm actively working on my side project - [MentorBrew](https://mentorbrew.com/) (if it doesnt work for you, probably I've switched off the server ðŸ˜›)

- I sometimes write articles on [medium](https://medium.com/@vidishajitani25)
